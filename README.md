# Data from my Master's thesis
This repositary contains the results from both of the proposed methods and the recordings used in the subjective listening test. This is only a supplementary material.

### This page contains multiple folders:
- **results_dpai_cpa** = this folder contains the .wav files generated by the proposed U-PHAIN-TF-CPA variant, computed from the DPAI dataset 
- **results_dpai_gcpa** = this folder contains the .wav files generated by the proposed U-PHAIN-TF-GCPA variant, computed from the DPAI dataset
- **results_irmas_cpa** = this folder contains the .wav files generated by the proposed U-PHAIN-TF-CPA variant, computed from the IRMAS dataset 
- **results_irmas_gcpa** = this folder contains the .wav files generated by the proposed U-PHAIN-TF-GCPA variant, computed from the IRMAS dataset
- **subjective_test** = this folder contains the .wav files utilized in the subjective listening test, it contains three subfolders:
  * **data_original** = this folder contains the original .wav files selected for the listening test
  * **data_corrupted** = this folder contains the corrupted .wav files selected for the listening test
  * **data_corrupted** = this folder contains the reconstructed .wav files selected for the listening test, the reconstructed signals from all four methods are present (JanssenTF, DPAI, U-PHAIN-TF-CPA and U-PHAIN-TF-GCPA)
